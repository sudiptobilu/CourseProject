Have faced challenges in artefact/noise removal during processing. It significantly calculated the spectral behaviour of the PCG signal. To develop a bio signal acquisition system with telemetry application February 01, 2013 Dr. Akash Kumar Bhoi Shishir Srivastava Prasant Basnett February 2013, Biomedical instrumentation, Proposed biotelemetry system comprises of ECG simulators which generated all 12 leads configuration signals and processing of these signals by FDM module. Designed a LPD (H/W & S/W) in NIELVIS-II platform and Lab view. The filtered signals were acquired through the Data acquisition system i.e. NI ELVIS-II. This hardware gives us another platform i.e. further analysis of ECG signal in Lab View which will provide enormous research opportunities. 1 Call for Book Chapters December 31, 2020 Call For Book Chapters Book Title: Advances in Greener Energy Technologies Springer Book Series: Green Energy and Technology (ISSN: 1865-3529) **Indexed in Scopus** https://www.springer.com/series/8059 Focus Area Science Technology Summer Fellowship [FAST-SF] 2018 Focus Area Science Technology Summer Fellowship [FAST-SF] 2018 Selected and attended Focus Area Science Technology Summer Fellowship [FAST-SF] -2018 offered by Inter Academy Panel [Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru, Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi and The National Academy of Sciences, India, Allahabad] (Teacher category) at Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur.
